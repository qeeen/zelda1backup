for mapping use a "pipe" system, everything starts closed, designate "biomes" for different sections of squares
biomes like deserts will be mostly 4 way, while forests will be more closed off, like creating a snaking "pipe"
run dijkstras to see if every square can be reached

dungeons find pieces of train tickets? use a train to travel to the next area

genshin style unit switching? with each unit having maybe 3 item slots? 
free changing outside, and out of combat, change once at the start of each room in dungeons
maybe just some forced switching system? almost like ammo, but you simply rotate when you run out of energy
certain items in shops, others in specific drop tables

2 links?

shrine leveling system, where you use a shrine to level up, and you pick an ability based on circumstances?

class tree? pick a class, each level up gives an option out of a set abilities to pick from? maybe need certain reqs like in fallout?
